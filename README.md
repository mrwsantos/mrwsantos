### Hi there, since you're already here you can call me Mr.W or just Will ðŸ‘‹

**`I work with creativity, for me, it's visceral, it's gut instinct!`**

I'm a curious front-end Web Developer who enjoys creating art and has a lot of fun doing it. To balance things out, I strum the guitar (poorly) and listen to Indie and Rock music. I'm into almost everything that stimulates imagination, such as photography, books, flicks, and photorealistic design. And, just like a _true Developer_, I am passionate about coffee.
